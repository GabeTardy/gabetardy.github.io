        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Gabe Tardy, a second-year MS student in Civil Engineering at Tennessee Technological University. My research is currently in the structural mechanics subdiscipline, where I study idealized snap-buckling of arches using specialized materials with the finite element method using primarily custom-built material models. I am also a licensed Engineer Intern in the state of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>I am broadly interested in structural engineering and train/transit infrastructure. On a more technical level, I am particularly interested in large-scale physical testing and finite element modeling.</p>
        <p>On the side, I enjoy cooking and baking, playing piano, working out, tending plants, sewing, painting, drawing, 3D printing, and reading. Sometimes I have time to sleep, too.</p>

        <h1>About this Website</h1>
        <p>This website serves as a homepage for my projects, research, and other work. It contains links to my GitHub repositories where the source code for most of my projects can be found.</p>

        <p>I coded it from scratch. The font in use is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata">Inconsolata</a>. The color palette in use is <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/">Solarized</a>.</p>

        <h1>Contact Me</h1>
        <p>The best way to contact me is via email: <span class="b">gjtardy (then the answer to life, the universe, and everything) (at) tntech.edu.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabetardy/">LinkedIn</a>. I do not maintain other social media, so I apologize if you have previously tried to contact me elsewhere.</p>

        <h1>Website Redesign</h1>
        <p>I recently redesigned this website from scratch with the intention of improving accessibility and professionalism and consequently several files have been (re)moved. The old website organization and files have been preserved in the <a href="./prev">prev</a> subdirectory, but I encourage you to use the new website as I have no intention of maintaining the old format.</p>
